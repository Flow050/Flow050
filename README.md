- 👋 Hi, I’m @Flow050
- 👀 I’m interested in learning front-end development and making some new friends interested in that too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to master CSS and JS, started a few weeks ago because my RL-Job got boring.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing so far,as im just getting into it i would more likely need something like a "mentor" who could explain stuff i just cant understand.
- 📫 How to reach me? Actually i just joined Github a few minutes ago, so im not quite sure if there is a way to contact me directly on this plattform, if thats the case go for it,
i am happy about every word written to me as im extremly Introverted and dont have that much conversations in the world out there.
